How It Was Built
This project was created using Adobe Dreamweaver. Dreamweaver was used for writing HTML and CSS code, as well as for organizing the project files and folders. The website uses the Bootstrap 4 framework to provide a responsive layout, and jQuery was used for enabling the interactive elements like the image carousel.
